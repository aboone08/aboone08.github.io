On this journey that we call life, I have been given a whole bunch of lemons along the way. After a car accident that lead me to reevaluate major items in my life I eventually was presented with the opportunity to participate in a local coding boot camp which I jumped at the chance to explore. One of the many, ahem, characteristics about myself is that I love the idea of continuous exploration and learning. It is through this quest for knowledge that I enjoy meeting and helping new people. In helping others, on more than one occasion I would be asked to help create or improve their websites and at the time of their asking, I was not in the position to do such a task although the task intrigued me on many levels. With this desire to help those in need, in addition to my own intrigue of web development and design I began to soak in the information that was presented to me through the Gainesville Dev Academy in 2016. After the completion of the program I took on a brief internship with a tech company in Gainesville, Florida where I gained experience optimizing landing pages and well as creating pages for their existing site. After the duration of the internship I would go on to work independently from online tutorials.

One day, as I was scrolling through my newsfeed and playing around on the innerwebs I came across an advertisement for a chance at a Grow with Google Scholarship. At the time, I had little to no doubt that I would even be close to considered for such an opportunity but I applied anyway because I could not stop thinking about how even if I would be so lucky to be chosen for the scholarship opportunity what that would mean for advancing my skillset in addition to the future employment opportunities that such an opportunity could bring. Not only was I awarded the scholarship but after completing the scholarship round, I was selected to continue with the Nanodegree portion fully paid through the Grow with Google Scholarship. Needless to say that I was humbled and ecstatic!!

Before learning about my selection in the next round of the Nanodegree selection I came across another scholarship application for Women in Tech for a full-stack web development program. Not certain of what was to come of the Grow with Google scholarship I applied and voil√†! I was awarded the Women in Tech scholarship for the Flatiron Full-stack Web Development Program.

I am excited to dive further in my knowledge of web development and web design. I know I need to work on my hesitation and address the dreaded impostor syndrome but most importantly I am looking forward to being creative and helping others get their creativeness, business goals, entrepreneurial dreams out through the use of my own ever changing and ever growing web dev skills!!!
